                    <h1>My name is Elijah Creighton,</h1>
                    <p>
                        I am a senior at the University of South Florida working towards my bachelor’s 
                        in information science with a concentration in web development technologies. With my ability and desire 
                        to learn and collaborate in rapidly changing environments and compositions, I am eager to tackle web development 
                        or design challenges to achieve lasting impacts on user experience.

                        I began my college career at Hillsborough Community College at the Plant City campus in August of 2018. 
                        After receiving my A.A. in computer information systems in May 2021 I decided to transfer to the University 
                        of South Florida’s Tampa campus. There I began learning the ins and outs of web development and design. 
                        I worked on a great multitude of projects during my time at USF. After creating my first website from 
                        scratch in my Web Page Design and Management class, I learned not only how to create and maintain a website, 
                        but also that I really enjoyed doing so. Creating something to solve a problem, inevitably coming across 
                        some bug that prevents it from working, then finally coming up with a fix that just works.
                    </p>

                        I was proud of what I made when I first created and published my first web site. Of course, 
                        I’d be too embarrassed to show it off now as I don’t think it’s even close to the kind of quality work, 
                        I am capable of putting out. Although I do have it saved on my hard drive somewhere. Maybe someday...
